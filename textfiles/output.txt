In the evenings, ________ cups of tea and plates of supper, we ________ ________ in the chintz armchairs in the ________ room. Always ________ a wary eye on the overweight, but ever-hungry dogs and our supper, we ________ ________ down to ________ well into the night. I ________ a lot of my family 's history ________ those long summer evenings. As daylight ________ from the sky, the lamps in the room ________ ________ ________ on, and the gas fire ________ ________ ________. The four of us ________ ________ ________, and I ________ ________ so many questions that even Daphne, with her sharp memory and fund of family stories, ________ not always ________ them. Then, some time after midnight, with the two dogs gently ________ in their favourite armchairs, we ________ yawningly ________ up to our beds.

On a Saturday in the fall of 2009, when Brandon and I ________ ________ the possibilities for a free and ________ day, we ________ to ________ ________ for our dream farmhouse. We ________ both ________ ________ ready for ________ new. We ________ ________ the same excitement that our children ________ at nightfall, ________ into the darkness ________ to ________ a firefly to ________. We ________ ________ for ________ magical, ________ we ________ ________ our arms around and ________ home with us. So we ________ a lunch for the kids and ________ them we ________ ________ on an adventure. They ________ us ________ looks, inquisitively ________, `` but where ________ we ________?'' Once ________ into their car seats they ________ only ________ in the destination. Of course, we ________ not ________ a destination and we ________ from ________ that bit of information. After ________ a few books and toys to ________ kids, we ________ ________ for our dream farmhouse.

When I ________ to ________ time in the region, I ________ ________ stories about sea otters. These days, the otters ________ n't so few and far between. In fact, when I ________ my lifelong dream of someday ________ a sea otter, people almost ________ at me! There ________ lots, I ________ ________, along the outer coast. Finally, my moment ________. I ________ on a small boat and there they ________, their dark heads ________ out above the white water where the waves ________ ________ up against the rocky coastline. They ________ n't close, and the rough waves ________ it hard to ________, but in that moment I ________ what it ________ to ________ a dream ________ true. It ________ a reminder that things ________ ________, that species ________ ________, and that I ________ ________ ________ of some of the concern for the otters that I ________ ________ ________ inside since I ________ a girl.

Writers ________ ________ achingly alone, but I ________ tremendously fortunate to ________ part of wonderfully supportive scholarly, academic, and family groups. My deepest debts for this work ________ ________ to those who ________ ________ me in ________ food studies as an ________ discipline. In countless ways, this work ________ not ________ possible without theirs.

War ________ inconceivable without some image, or concept, of the enemy. It ________ the presence of the enemy that ________ ________ and justification to war. ` War ________ from feelings of ________', ________ Carl Schmitt. ` War ________ its own strategic, tactical, and other rules and points of view, but they all ________ that the political decision ________ already ________ ________ as to who the enemy ________'. The concept of the enemy ________ fundamental to the moral assessment of war : ` The basic aim of a nation at war in ________ an image of the enemy ________ to ________ as sharply as possible the act of ________ from the act of murder'. However, we ________ to ________ cautious about ________ of war and the image of the enemy that ________ it in an abstract and uniform way. Rather, both ________ ________ ________ for the cultural and contingent phenomena that they ________.

Three-year-olds ________ n't ________ to ________ with the same rules and realities adults ________. Because of that, children ________ to ________ more imaginative and creative with their ideas. They ________ possibilities where the rest of us ________ rules, boundaries, or impossibilities. That ________ why they ________ famous for ________ on walls -- you ________ a perfectly ________ ________ room that ________ n't ________ ________ ; they ________ a blank canvas. Even if it ________ just for 30 minutes, ________ life from the angle of a semi-careless child ________ ________ you a new perspective on how you ________ your time and deal with household problems or work challenges. For that reason alone, it ________ valuable to ________ yourself ________ as you ________ if you ________ just a child : free - ________, boundless, uncontrollably creative, and unafraid to ________ new things.

Most linguists and local community members ________ that education and literacy in the local language ________ necessary to ________ vitality, or to ________ a language ________ with endangerment. Some local communities ________ this notion, ________ to ________ their oral traditions and to ________ solely on them. There ________, however, a cost to this decision, as it ________ the domains in which the language ________ ________ ________. Regardless, most regard literacy as essential for local languages. Yet more than half of all languages ________ no ________ form, and so a ________ system ________ to ________ ________ for them in order to ________ them in education and literacy programs. Basic pedagogical and reference materials ________ ________, ________ textbooks, dictionaries and usable descriptive grammars. Such materials ________ readily available for languages of wider communication, but not for the majority of local languages. In addition, ________ material ________ ________ for literacy as well.

03
There ________ a misconception that older people ________ to a special tribe, all with the same problems, opinions and attitudes. Yet older people ________ just as different from each other as ________ members of younger generational groups. How ________ it ________ otherwise in view of the wide range of different experiences everyone ________ as their life ________ from childhood to old age? There ________ differences ________ by family backgrounds, education, careers and relationships. All these help ________ a person 's character and outlook on life. This ________ not ________ superior virtues on the elderly. They ________ ________ wisdom, good humour and tolerance, but ________ just as likely to ________ cantankerous, ________ and ________. Like everyone else, the old ________ a ________ bunch, but each ________ an individual with their own particular interests and personality.

While we usually ________ negatively of deviance, it actually ________ ________ functional in a society. Any hostility toward deviants ________ behavioral conformity with social expectations. It ________ group identity by ________ the ________ from the ________ members ________ on an agreement on the norms. We ________ ________ familiar with the phrase `` the exception ________ the rule.'' Deviance ________ us the boundary, or line, that ________ not ________ ________, ________ not only the importance of the norm but its relative permissible zone for behavior. For example, if there ________ a rule that `` food ________ not ________ in the classroom,'' a person with the candy bar or bag of chips ________ not ________ ________ by the teacher ; yet a person ________ to class with a fast-food meal ________ rebuke and ejection. Others in the class now ________ where the line ________ ________ and ________ ________ their patterns of behavior accordingly.

You ________ ________ yourself a lot of time and energy if, over the next few years, you ________ serious consideration to what ________ most important to you and what you ________ to ________ with your life. ________ the myth, however, that you ________ ________ to ________ up with some ambitious, ________ life plan and then ________ it until the end of the rainbow. Things ________ that ________ ________ and unforeseen. Events in the world ________ ________ the landscape. Opportunities ________ ________ your way that you never ________ ________ ________ before. Friendships and ________ ________ ________ up other possibilities. Your priorities and values ________ ________ as you ________ new experiences and ________ ________ to other options. ________ you ________ now ________ likely ________ as you ________ new things, ________ new skills, and ________ in new directions. In fact, it ________ imperative that you ________ open to these changes.

If you ________ a new job, and you ________ ________ to ________ from your current job, ________ I ________ a common sense suggestion? Unless there ________ a very special circumstance, I strongly ________ you not ________ from your current job with only the verbal agreement or an informal email ________ you that you ________ the future job. I ________ chills up my spine when people ________ this or even ________ it. There ________ still that chance ________ unforeseen ________ ________ between the verbal offer and actuality. You ________ ________ your intention to ________ from the job only when you ________ in your possession a ________ and ________ offer or employment contract, on company letterhead, with an ________ start date for your new job. For me, this ________ as much an issue of common sense as ________ you ________ ________ both ways before ________ a street.

Whether you ________ a wrestler ________ to ________ a league title next season, or a student with an entrepreneurial spirit who ________ to ________ your own business and ________ a successful career, you ________ to ________ the right steps. And ________ n't ________ ________ up in ________ that any success you ________ as a student ________ no ________ on, or relationship to, future success in the `` real'' world. You ________ in the `` real'' world -- your world. Success now ________ success later, even if the fields or venues change. ________ n't ________ what you ________ ________ `` small'' successes. Michael Jordan 's first step to basketball success ________ ________ his high school team after ________ ________ earlier. Your successes -- however great or small -- in academics, social clubs, fine arts, or sports ________ ________ the way to future success. What ________ important at the moment ________ not how much you ________, but how much you ________ about the process of ________. Because once you ________ the process, you ________ ________ it in the field or area of your choice, where you ________ to ________ the gifts you ________.

Next, ________ our great-grandchildren 's great-grandchildren ________ that ________ if the state of the world ________ ________ ________, ________ that they ________ not ________ exactly how it ________ today? If the answer to this second question ________ no, this ________ we ________ ________ battles we ________ not ________ to ________. If change ________ inevitable, which it ________, we ________ then ________ a third question : how ________ we ________ the benefits that our descendants ________ from the natural world? In other words, how ________ we ________ changes that ________ ________ favourable to the future human condition, as well as ________ the losses of species that ________ ________ important in unknown ways in future?

We ________ that the ethical principles of justice ________ an essential foundation for policies to ________ unborn generations and the poorest countries from climate change. ________ issues ________ in connection with current and persistently inadequate aid for these nations, in the face of ________ threats to agriculture and water supply, and the rules of international trade that mainly ________ rich countries. ________ aid for the world 's poorest peoples ________ ________ an essential part of effective mitigation. With 20 percent of carbon emissions from-LRB- mostly tropical-RRB- deforestation, carbon credits for forest preservation ________ ________ aid to poorer countries with one of the most cost-effective forms of abatement. Perhaps the most cost-effective but politically ________ policy reform ________ ________ the removal of several ________ billions of dollars of direct annual subsidies from the two biggest recipients in the OECD -- destructive industrial agriculture and fossil fuels. Even a small amount of this money ________ ________ the already rapid rate of technical progress and investment in renewable energy in many areas, as well as ________ the essential switch to conservation agriculture.

We ________ about to ________ on ________ one of the most important habits of all : gratitude. After ________ and ________ hundreds of studies, the University of California, Berkeley, ________ that gratitude ________ one of the most reliable methods for ________ happiness and life satisfaction. It ________ feelings of optimism, joy, pleasure, and enthusiasm. It ________ anxiety and depression, ________ the immune system, ________ blood pressure, ________ symptoms of illness, and ________ us less ________ by aches and pains. It ________ us to ________ more and ________ better care of our health. Grateful people ________ more hours of sleep each night, ________ less time awake before ________ asleep, and ________ more ________ upon ________. Gratitude ________ people more resilient and ________ them ________ from traumatic events.

Some ________ there ________ no value to dreams, but it ________ wrong to ________ these nocturnal dramas as irrelevant. There ________ ________ to ________ ________ in ________. We ________ ________ more ________, more complete, and more on track. We ________ ________ inspiration, information, and comfort. Albert Einstein ________ that his theory of relativity ________ ________ by a dream. In fact, he ________ that dreams ________ responsible for many of his discoveries. ________ why we ________ makes as much sense as ________ why we ________. ________ ________ an integral part of a healthy life. The great news ________ that this ________ true whether or not we ________ our dreams. Many people ________ ________ ________ with a new approach for a problem upon ________, even though they ________ n't ________ the specific dream.

Today 's rapidly ________ technological landscape ________ ________ a challenge for consumers who ________ ________ trust in technology and ________ skeptical of its ________ benefits. Anthropomorphic thought ________ ________ ________ this skepticism and distrust, and ________ especially consequential in consumer-product interactions where ________ mindful and conscious ________ important criteria for evaluation and accountability. For example, in a vehicle simulation study, Waytz and colleagues ________ that participants ________ higher levels of trust in autonomous vehicles-LRB- e.g., ________ cars-RRB- that ________ anthropomorphic cues-LRB- e.g., a name, gender, voice-RRB- than in those vehicles that ________ anthropomorphic cues. Moreover, participants in the ________ ________ vehicle ________ less ________ from an observer 's point of view, and in the event of an accident, ________ less likely to ________ their vehicles.

04
Corporations ________ rewards to ________ performance. Often these rewards ________ on ________ budgets and ________ risk. Rewards of this type cause managers to ________ in safe products that ________ little chance of a big loss but also little chance of a big profit. These rewards totally ________ any motivation to ________ riskier paths. The companies ________ the ________ at which low-risk products ________ ________ and ________, even if they ________ ________ for radical new ideas. The outcome ________ little appetite for risk and an overdose of incremental ideas. Interestingly, managers ________ ________ with the outcome, blind to the behavior that the organization ________ explicitly or implicitly ________. A badly ________ measurement or reward system ________ the rest of the rules, even if optimally ________.

05
Values and their ________ beliefs ________ lenses through which we ________ the world. The views that these lenses ________ ________ often of what life ________ to ________ like, not what it ________. For example, Americans value individualism so highly that they ________ to ________ almost everyone as free and equal in ________ the goal of success. This value ________ them to the significance of the circumstances that ________ people from ________ success. The dire consequences of family poverty, parents ' low education, and dead-end jobs ________ to ________ from sight. Instead, Americans ________ the unsuccessful as not ________ advantage of opportunities, or as ________ some inherent laziness or dull minds. And they `` ________'' they ________ right, because the mass media ________ before their eyes ________ stories of individuals who ________ ________ despite the greatest of handicaps.

06
I ________ ________ that there ________ a few dancers who ________, as I once ________, that injuries ________ ________ primarily by accidents : ________, ________, ________ into someone or ________, or ________ to ________ your foot at the right instant and inadvertently ________ your ankle. But the longer I ________ ________, the more I ________ ________ that accidents ________ quite rare as causes of dance injuries. The majority of injuries ________ ________ -- and ________ -- by how you ________ at your ________, consistently and over time. ________ incorrectly just once usually ________ n't ________ you ; your body ________ quite resilient and ________ ________ back from some amount of abuse. But if you ________ incorrectly again and again, class after class, performance after performance, day after day, and year after year, your body -- or some part of it -- ________ finally ________ out. It ________ simply ________ to ________ anymore.

The answer to the question about the ________ of colour in ________-LRB- and in fabric-RRB- ________ fairly simple. Ultraviolet radiation ________ a high energy form of light and, as sunbathers ________ only too aware, ________ present in ordinary daylight. Over time, ultraviolet radiation ________ gradually ________ up the molecules in pigment, ________ smaller, colourless molecules as products. There ________ also a second process of degradation in which pigment molecules ________ ________ chemically with oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, a process ________ as oxidation. As with photolysis, this ________ the structure of the molecule and, as a consequence, ________ the manner in which it ________ light of various colours. As the amount of ________ pigment in a ________ area on a canvas gradually ________, so the colour ________ to us, as onlookers, to ________. So a ________ pigment ________ n't actually ________ colour ; it simply ________ weaker in the mix of pigments over time.

Since the pull of gravity ________ the stability of the body ________ the performance of physical activity, the balance or appropriate distribution of those gravitational forces upon the body ________ essential to ________ stability or ` balance'. The location of the centre of gravity, or the point around which the mass or sum of gravitational forces ________ equally ________ or ` ________', ________ thus of vital importance in the performance of physical skills. We ________ that the lower the centre of gravity and the closer it ________ to the base of support, the more stable an object. Thus when rugby players ________ they ________ to ________ their body weight as low as possible to ________ ________ ________ backwards. Likewise, when those ________ in a tug-of-war pull on the rope they ________ to ________ their centre of gravity by ________ backwards and ________ their feet well in front of them to ________ stability and ________ their chances of ________ ________ forward by their opponents.
