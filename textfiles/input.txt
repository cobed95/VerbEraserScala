Dear Mr. Reese,
A few days ago, I submitted my application and recipe for the 2nd Annual DC Metro Cooking Contest. However, I would like to change my recipe if it is possible. I have checked the website again, but I could only find information about the contest date, time, and prizes. I couldn’t see any information about changing recipes. I have just created a great new recipe, and I believe people will love this more than the one I have already submitted. Please let me know if I can change my submitted recipe. I look forward to your response.
Best Regards, Sophia Walker

Dear Mr. Rivera:
I want to thank you for bringing members of “Puerto Ricans for a Positive Image” to the American Broadcasting System (ABS) this week to meet with me and other ABS senior executives. The heartfelt passion for portraying more positive images of the Puerto Rican community was certainly heard by our executives. As we discussed in our meeting, it was never our intent to misrepresent images of your community, and the show in question no longer airs on ABS.
ABS is known for the diversity of its characters, and over the years we have been continually recognized by multiple groups for stories that challenge stereotypes and bring different perspectives and voices to the screen. We apologize for any inadvertent offense taken and can assure you that we will continue to strive to reflect the vast diversity of our audience with respect and, where appropriate, with self-deprecating humor.
Thank you again for meeting with us and for voicing your concerns.
Sincerely,
Victoria Howard

The waves were perfect for surfing. Dave, however, just could not stay on his board. He had tried more than ten times to stand up but never managed it. He felt that he would never succeed. He was about to give up when he looked at the sea one last time. The swelling waves seemed to say, “Come on, Dave. One more try!” Taking a deep breath, he picked up his board and ran into the water. He waited for the right wave. Finally, it came. He jumped up onto the board just like he had practiced. And this time, standing upright, he battled the wave all the way back to shore. Walking out of the water joyfully, he cheered, “Wow, I did it!”

In the evenings, clutching cups of tea and plates of supper, we would gather in the chintz armchairs in the sitting room. Always keeping a wary eye on the overweight, but ever-hungry dogs and our supper, we would settle down to talk well into the night. I learnt a lot of my family’s history during those long summer evenings. As daylight faded from the sky, the lamps in the room would be turned on, and the gas fire would be lit. The four of us would sit talking, and I would ask so many questions that even Daphne, with her sharp memory and fund of family stories, could not always answer them. Then, some time after midnight, with the two dogs gently snoring in their favourite armchairs, we would yawningly creep up to our beds.

On a Saturday in the fall of 2009, when Brandon and I were assessing the possibilities for a free and unscheduled day, we decided to go shopping for our dream farmhouse. We had both been feeling ready for something new. We were feeling the same excitement that our children have at nightfall, looking into the darkness trying to find a firefly to catch. We were hoping for something magical, something we could wrap our arms around and take home with us. So we packed a lunch for the kids and informed them we were going on an adventure. They gave us questioning looks, inquisitively pleading, “but where are we going?” Once strapped into their car seats they were only interested in the destination. Of course, we did not have a destination and we refrained from sharing that bit of information. After packing a few books and toys to occupy kids, we went shopping for our dream farmhouse.

When I started to spend time in the region, I began hearing stories about sea otters. These days, the otters aren’t so few and far between. In fact, when I confessed my lifelong dream of someday seeing a sea otter, people almost laughed at me! There are lots, I was told, along the outer coast. Finally, my moment came. I was on a small boat and there they were, their dark heads sticking out above the white water where the waves were crashing up against the rocky coastline. They weren’t close, and the rough waves made it hard to see, but in that moment I knew what it was to have a dream come true. It was a reminder that things can change, that species can recover, and that I could let go of some of the concern for the otters that I’d been holding inside since I was a girl.

Writers can feel achingly alone, but I am tremendously fortunate to be part of wonderfully supportive scholarly, academic, and family groups. My deepest debts for this work are owed to those who have preceded me in establishing food studies as an accepted discipline. In countless ways, this work would not be possible without theirs. I have recommended many of their works in the suggestions for further reading that follow each entry and in the general suggestions that conclude the volume. But I have also benefited from the personal support and encouragement of many individuals — too many to name here — at gatherings such as the conference of the Association for the Study of Food and Society and the Oxford Symposium of Food and Cookery. A more welcoming and nurturing group of scholars cannot be imagined.

War is inconceivable without some image, or concept, of the enemy. It is the presence of the enemy that gives meaning and justification to war. ‘War follows from feelings of hatred’, wrote Carl Schmitt. ‘War has its own strategic, tactical, and other rules and points of view, but they all presuppose that the political decision has already been made as to who the enemy is’. The concept of the enemy is fundamental to the moral assessment of war: ‘The basic aim of a nation at war in establishing an image of the enemy is to distinguish as sharply as possible the act of killing from the act of murder’. However, we need to be cautious about thinking of war and the image of the enemy that informs it in an abstract and uniform way. Rather, both must be seen for the cultural and contingent phenomena that they are.

Three-year-olds don’t have to deal with the same rules and realities adults do. Because of that, children tend to be more imaginative and creative with their ideas. They see possibilities where the rest of us see rules, boundaries, or impossibilities. That’s why they’re famous for writing on walls — you see a perfectly painted living room that shouldn’t be touched; they see a blank canvas. Even if it’s just for 30 minutes, seeing life from the angle of a semi-careless child can give you a new perspective on how you spend your time and deal with household problems or work challenges. For that reason alone, it’s valuable to imagine yourself acting as you would if you were just a child: free- spirited, boundless, uncontrollably creative, and unafraid to try new things.

Most linguists and local community members agree that education and literacy in the local language are necessary to maintain vitality, or to revitalize a language threatened with endangerment. Some local communities reject this notion, wanting to preserve their oral traditions and to rely solely on them. There is, however, a cost to this decision, as it limits the domains in which the language can be used. Regardless, most regard literacy as essential for local languages. Yet more than half of all languages have no written form, and so a writing system needs to be developed for them in order to use them in education and literacy programs. Basic pedagogical and reference materials are needed, including textbooks, dictionaries and usable descriptive grammars. Such materials are readily available for languages of wider communication, but not for the majority of local languages. In addition, reading material is needed for literacy as well.

03
There is a misconception that older people belong to a special tribe, all with the same problems, opinions and attitudes. Yet older people are just as different from each other as are members of younger generational groups. How can it be otherwise in view of the wide range of different experiences everyone has as their life progresses from childhood to old age? There are differences formed by family backgrounds, education, careers and relationships. All these help shape a person’s character and outlook on life. This does not confer superior virtues on the elderly. They may have wisdom, good humour and tolerance, but are just as likely to be cantankerous, boring and narrow-minded. Like everyone else, the old are a mixed bunch, but each is an individual with their own particular interests and personality.

04
While we usually think negatively of deviance, it actually can prove functional in a society. Any hostility toward deviants promotes behavioral conformity with social expectations. It strengthens group identity by separating the nonconforming from the well-behaved members centering on an agreement on the norms. We may be familiar with the phrase “the exception makes the rule.” Deviance shows us the boundary, or line, that must not be crossed, highlighting not only the importance of the norm but its relative permissible zone for behavior. For example, if there is a rule that “food is not permitted in the classroom,” a person with the candy bar or bag of chips might not be admonished by the teacher; yet a person arriving to class with a fast-food meal experiences rebuke and ejection. Others in the class now know where the line is drawn and can adjust their patterns of behavior accordingly.

05
You can save yourself a lot of time and energy if, over the next few years, you give serious consideration to what is most important to you and what you want to do with your life. Avoid the myth, however, that you are supposed to come up with some ambitious, detailed life plan and then follow it until the end of the rainbow. Things happen that are unexpected and unforeseen. Events in the world will alter the landscape. Opportunities will come your way that you never would have considered before. Friendships and networking will open up other possibilities. Your priorities and values will evolve as you gain new experiences and are exposed to other options. Anything you plan now will likely shift as you learn new things, develop new skills, and grow in new directions. In fact, it is imperative that you remain open to these changes.

If you have a new job, and you are going to resign from your current job, may I make a common sense suggestion? Unless there is a very special circumstance, I strongly suggest you not resign from your current job with only the verbal agreement or an informal email telling you that you have the future job. I get chills up my spine when people do this or even consider it. There is still that chance something unforeseen could happen between the verbal offer and actuality. You should announce your intention to resign from the job only when you have in your possession a written and signed offer or employment contract, on company letterhead, with an accompanying start date for your new job. For me, this is as much an issue of common sense as suggesting you should look both ways before crossing a street.

Whether you’re a wrestler planning to win a league title next season, or a student with an entrepreneurial spirit who wants to start your own business and build a successful career, you need to plan the right steps. And don’t get caught up in thinking that any success you experience as a student has no bearing on, or relationship to, future success in the “real” world. You are in the “real” world — your world. Success now breeds success later, even if the fields or venues change. Don’t discount what you might consider “small” successes. Michael Jordan’s first step to basketball success was making his high school team after being cut earlier. Your successes — however great or small — in academics, social clubs, fine arts, or sports can pave the way to future success. What’s important at the moment is not how much you achieve, but how much you learn about the process of achieving. Because once you learn the process, you can apply it in the field or area of your choice, where you want to use the gifts you have.

Whenever our urge is to fight a specific biological change, we should ask the following triplet of questions. Will our efforts have made much difference a few hundred years hence? If not, this means we are fighting a battle we will inevitably lose. Next, will our great-grandchildren’s great-grandchildren be that bothered if the state of the world has been altered, given that they will not know exactly how it is today? If the answer to this second question is no, this means we are fighting battles we do not need to win. If change is inevitable, which it is, we should then ask a third question: how can we maximize the benefits that our descendants derive from the natural world? In other words, how can we promote changes that might be favourable to the future human condition, as well as avoid the losses of species that might be important in unknown ways in future?

We argue that the ethical principles of justice provide an essential foundation for policies to protect unborn generations and the poorest countries from climate change. Related issues arise in connection with current and persistently inadequate aid for these nations, in the face of growing threats to agriculture and water supply, and the rules of international trade that mainly benefit rich countries. Increasing aid for the world’s poorest peoples can be an essential part of effective mitigation. With 20 percent of carbon emissions from (mostly tropical) deforestation, carbon credits for forest preservation would combine aid to poorer countries with one of the most cost-effective forms of abatement. Perhaps the most cost-effective but politically complicated policy reform would be the removal of several hundred billions of dollars of direct annual subsidies from the two biggest recipients in the OECD — destructive industrial agriculture and fossil fuels. Even a small amount of this money would accelerate the already rapid rate of technical progress and investment in renewable energy in many areas, as well as encourage the essential switch to conservation agriculture.

We are about to embark on creating one of the most important habits of all: gratitude. After conducting and reviewing hundreds of studies, the University of California, Berkeley, concluded that gratitude is one of the most reliable methods for increasing happiness and life satisfaction. It boosts feelings of optimism, joy, pleasure, and enthusiasm. It reduces anxiety and depression, strengthens the immune system, lowers blood pressure, reduces symptoms of illness, and makes us less bothered by aches and pains. It encourages us to exercise more and take better care of our health. Grateful people get more hours of sleep each night, spend less time awake before falling asleep, and feel more refreshed upon awakening. Gratitude makes people more resilient and helps them recover from traumatic events.

Some believe there is no value to dreams, but it is wrong to dismiss these nocturnal dramas as irrelevant. There is something to be gained in remembering. We can feel more connected, more complete, and more on track. We can receive inspiration, information, and comfort. Albert Einstein stated that his theory of relativity was inspired by a dream. In fact, he claimed that dreams were responsible for many of his discoveries. Asking why we dream makes as much sense as questioning why we breathe. Dreaming is an integral part of a healthy life. The great news is that this is true whether or not we remember our dreams. Many people report being inspired with a new approach for a problem upon awakening, even though they don’t remember the specific dream.

Today’s rapidly changing technological landscape can represent a challenge for consumers who might lack trust in technology and be skeptical of its purported benefits. Anthropomorphic thought can help remedy this skepticism and distrust, and is especially consequential in consumer-product interactions where being mindful and conscious are important criteria for evaluation and accountability. For example, in a vehicle simulation study, Waytz and colleagues found that participants reported higher levels of trust in autonomous vehicles (e.g., self-driving cars) that featured anthropomorphic cues (e.g., a name, gender, voice) than in those vehicles that lacked anthropomorphic cues. Moreover, participants in the simulated anthropomorphized vehicle felt less stressed from an observer’s point of view, and in the event of an accident, were less likely to blame their vehicles.

04
Corporations establish rewards to drive performance. Often these rewards focus on meeting budgets and avoiding risk. Rewards of this type cause managers to invest in safe products that pose little chance of a big loss but also little chance of a big profit. These rewards totally block any motivation to explore riskier paths. The companies reward the speed at which low-risk products are created and marketed, even if they are hoping for radical new ideas. The outcome is little appetite for risk and an overdose of incremental ideas. Interestingly, managers get frustrated with the outcome, blind to the behavior that the organization is explicitly or implicitly rewarding. A badly designed measurement or reward system mutes the rest of the rules, even if optimally designed.

05
Values and their supporting beliefs are lenses through which we see the world. The views that these lenses provide are often of what life ought to be like, not what it is. For example, Americans value individualism so highly that they tend to see almost everyone as free and equal in pursuing the goal of success. This value blinds them to the significance of the circumstances that keep people from achieving success. The dire consequences of family poverty, parents’ low education, and dead-end jobs tend to drop from sight. Instead, Americans see the unsuccessful as not taking advantage of opportunities, or as having some inherent laziness or dull minds. And they “know” they are right, because the mass media dangle before their eyes enticing stories of individuals who have succeeded despite the greatest of handicaps.

I would guess that there are a few dancers who believe, as I once did, that injuries are caused primarily by accidents: slipping, tripping, running into someone or something, or forgetting to point your foot at the right instant and inadvertently twisting your ankle. But the longer I’ve danced, the more I’ve understood that accidents are quite rare as causes of dance injuries. The majority of injuries are caused — and prevented — by how you work at your dancing, consistently and over time. Working incorrectly just once usually won’t hurt you; your body is quite resilient and can bounce back from some amount of abuse. But if you work incorrectly again and again, class after class, performance after performance, day after day, and year after year, your body — or some part of it — will finally give out. It will simply refuse to function anymore.

The answer to the question about the fading of colour in painting (and in fabric) is fairly simple. Ultraviolet radiation is a high energy form of light and, as sunbathers are only too aware, is present in ordinary daylight. Over time, ultraviolet radiation can gradually break up the molecules in pigment, leaving smaller, colourless molecules as products. There is also a second process of degradation in which pigment molecules may react chemically with oxygen molecules in the atmosphere, a process known as oxidation. As with photolysis, this alters the structure of the molecule and, as a consequence, changes the manner in which it absorbs light of various colours. As the amount of coloured pigment in a given area on a canvas gradually diminishes, so the colour seems to us, as onlookers, to fade. So a given pigment doesn’t actually change colour; it simply becomes weaker in the mix of pigments over time.

08
Since the pull of gravity influences the stability of the body during the performance of physical activity, the balance or appropriate distribution of those gravitational forces upon the body is essential to promoting stability or ‘balance’. The location of the centre of gravity, or the point around which the mass or sum of gravitational forces is equally distributed or ‘balanced’, is thus of vital importance in the performance of physical skills. We know that the lower the centre of gravity and the closer it is to the base of support, the more stable an object. Thus when rugby players scrummage they attempt to get their body weight as low as possible to avoid being pushed backwards. Likewise, when those involved in a tug-of-war pull on the rope they try to lower their centre of gravity by leaning backwards and planting their feet well in front of them to increase stability and decrease their chances of being pulled forward by their opponents.
